# NOP Protein Benchmark Summary

This table summarizes the results of the 'NOP' protein benchmark, measuring the number of NOPs (no-operations) executed per second in different languages. Each language represents a unique 'protein fold'—a combination of computational, architectural, and philosophical scaffolding.

| Language  | NOPs/sec         | Protein Fold Description                |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Assembly  | 196,579,520      | Raw substrate, minimal overhead         |
| C         | 162,657,694      | Low-level, ABI, minimal abstraction     |
| C++       | 5,694,705        | Heavy scaffolding, templates, RTTI      |
| Python    | 2,853,013        | Interpreter, dynamic, massive overhead  |
| Rust      | 13,992,474       | Safety-first, LLVM, strict checks       |
| Julia     | 16,744,158       | JIT, hybrid compiled/dynamic runtime    |

**NOP**: The glyph-protein representing the minimal computational intent, revealing the cost of abstraction and the structure of each language's runtime.

This experiment was performed on a Dell desktop running Ubuntu, blending programming, protein folding, and philosophical introspection with the help of AI.
